## Title
Secret Santa

## Description 
This function accepts an array of names and will return an object which maps each name in the original array to another of the names. No name will be assigned to itself and each name will appear once. The intended purpose is to be used to assign secret santa among a group of friends.
For now it is just a plain JavaScript file, to be used in Node, but later I plan to build a simple webpage which uses this function, so users can type in names then press a button to generate the list. To keep it private, I won't display each person's secret santa until a button is pressed.
This project was a chance for me to practise using recursion. The function uses a lot of loops; in the future when I have learnt more about bigO run time and practised recursion more, I would like to revisit this and see if I can make it more efficient, but fo rnow it has the desired functionality.

## How to use
Save the file. In the file, on line 46, replace "name1", "name2", "name3" and "name4" with the names you want to use for your secret santa. You can also add more names or delete some of them. Navigate to the folder where the file is saved then, using the terminal, type **node [filename]**. The terminal should then display the final secret santa results.

I used Codecademy to learn about recursion.
